```
public class HelloWorld {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.print("Hello world!");
	}
}
```

- in Java, all code lives inside of classes (e.g.  `public class`)
- put the code that you want to run inside of a method called main (e.g. `public static void main`)
- use curly braces `{ }` to denote beginning and ending of a section of code
- statements **must** end with semicolons

```
$ javac HelloWorld.java
$ java HelloWorld
Hello World!
```

the most common way to execute a Java program is to :
1. run through a Java compiler, or `javac`
2. run through Java interpreter, or `java`


The program below will print out the integers from 0 through 9.
```
public class HelloNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 0;
        while (x < 10) {
            System.out.print(x + " ");
            x = x + 1;
        }
    }
}
```

When we run this program, we see:
```
$ javac HelloNumbers.java
$ java HelloNumbers
$ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
```

- variables must be declared before use, and must have a type (e.g. `int x = 0`)
- `System.out.print(x + " ");` does not print on a new line, therefore the prompt ends up on the same line as the numbers

<h2> Static Typing <h2>

One of the most important features of Java is that all variables and expressions have a so-calledÂ ` static type`. Java variables can contain values of that type, and only that type. Furthermore, the type of a variable can never change.

One of the key features of the Java compiler is that it performs a static type check. For example, suppose we have the program below:

```
public class HelloNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 0;
        while (x < 10) {
            System.out.print(x + " ");
            x = x + 1;
        }
        x = "horse";
    }
}
```

Compiling this program, we see:

```
$ javac HelloNumbers.java 
HelloNumbers.java:9: error: incompatible types: String cannot be converted to int
        x = "horse";
                ^
1 error
```
- the compiler rejects this program before it even runs
